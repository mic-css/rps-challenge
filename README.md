Rock Paper Scissors NIKESH SUNFISH
===================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/makersacademy/rps-challenge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/makersacademy/rps-challenge)

About
-----
This game is an adaptation of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock based on a Makers Academy tale. The weekend challenge for week 3 of the coding bootcamp consisted of building the game using a TDD approach.

Objectives
----------
The main objective for this project was to build an interactive Rock Paper Scissors web app. I extended this challenge by including further logic based on Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock.

In order to give this simple application a Single-Page Application "feel" (and due to limited front-end knowledge), the app uses templates to switch out only the relevant sections of the page.

Instructions
----
To run this app, clone this repo from your chosen directory in the terminal.
From the project directory, run bundle to install required gems. You can then run the app on a local server using `rackup`:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mic-css/rps-challenge.git
$ cd rps-challenge
$ bundle
$ rackup
```

Languages
----
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* HTML / CSS
* Testing frameworks: RSpec / Capybara

Next steps
----------
* Improve / complete feature tests
* Add game instructions / screenshots to README
* Refactor to improve dynamic content and remove business logic from the views
* Fix Capybara weapon selection error
* Improve sign-in page design
* Add weapon images
